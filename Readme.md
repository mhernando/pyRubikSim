# pyRubikSim

*Python utils to simulate a **Rubik's Cube**. The aim of this code is to give a simple rubik cube simulator to test Discrete Planning Techniques.
The code was developed for AI teaching purpose.

*Also I have included a code file adapted from David Hogg <https://github.com/davidwhogg/MagicCube> to allow the 3D visualization of the cube
